Emily Calf 2012 Meal Sync Time

requires python-xlrd

This is a program to calculate the time periods of overlap (start times and end times)
between meals of calves within the same pen. In the excel files used by this program,
meals are written as a column of start times and end times (non-continuous bouts of feeding) 
with a separate column stating which bouts of feeding below to the same meal.
